# `_setmaxstdio`

Sets a maximum for the number of simultaneously open files at the stream I/O level.

## Syntax

```C
int _setmaxstdio(
   int new_max
);
```

### Parameters

*`new_max`*\
New maximum for the number of simultaneously open files at the stream I/O level.

## Return Value

Returns *`new_max`* if successful; -1 otherwise.

If *`new_max`* is less than **`_IOB_ENTRIES`**, or greater than the maximum number of handles available in the operating system, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function returns -1 and sets **`errno`** to **`EINVAL`**.

For information about these and other error codes, see [`_doserrno`, `errno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

The **`_setmaxstdio`** function changes the maximum value for the number of files that may be open simultaneously at the stream I/O level.

C run-time I/O now supports up to 8,192 files open simultaneously at the [low I/O level](../../c-runtime-library/low-level-i-o.md). This level includes files opened and accessed using the **`_open`**, **`_read`**, and **`_write`** family of I/O functions. By default, up to 512 files can be open simultaneously at the [stream I/O level](../../c-runtime-library/stream-i-o.md). This level includes files opened and accessed using the **`fopen`**, **`fgetc`**, and **`fputc`** family of functions. The limit of 512 open files at the stream I/O level can be increased to a maximum of 8,192 by use of the **`_setmaxstdio`** function.

Because stream I/O-level functions, such as **`fopen`**, are built on top of the low I/O-level functions, the maximum of 8,192 is a hard upper limit for the number of simultaneously open files accessed through the C run-time library.

> [!NOTE]
> This upper limit might be beyond what's supported by a particular Win32 platform and configuration.
