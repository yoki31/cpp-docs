# `fclose`, `_fcloseall`

Closes a stream (**`fclose`**) or closes all open streams (**`_fcloseall`**).

## Syntax

```C
int fclose(
   FILE *stream
);
int _fcloseall( void );
```

### Parameters

*`stream`*\
Pointer to **`FILE`** structure.

## Return Value

**`fclose`** returns 0 if the stream is successfully closed. **`_fcloseall`** returns the total number of streams closed. Both functions return **`EOF`** to indicate an error.

## Remarks

The **`fclose`** function closes *`stream`*. If *`stream`* is **`NULL`**, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, **`fclose`** sets **`errno`** to **`EINVAL`** and returns **`EOF`**. It's recommended that the *`stream`* pointer always be checked prior to calling this function.

See [`_doserrno`, `errno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md) for more information on these, and other error codes.

The **`_fcloseall`** function closes all open streams except **`stdin`**, **`stdout`**, **`stderr`** (and, in MS-DOS, **`_stdaux`** and **`_stdprn`**). It also closes and deletes any temporary files created by **`tmpfile`**. In both functions, all buffers associated with the stream are flushed prior to closing. System-allocated buffers are released when the stream is closed. Buffers assigned by the user with **`setbuf`** and **`setvbuf`** aren't automatically released.

**Note:** When these functions are used to close a stream, the underlying file descriptor and OS file handle (or socket) are closed, as well as the stream. Thus, if the file was originally opened as a file handle or file descriptor and is closed with **`fclose`**, don't also call **`_close`** to close the file descriptor; don't call the Win32 function **`CloseHandle`** to close the file handle.

**`fclose`** and **`_fcloseall`** include code to protect against interference from other threads. For non-locking version of a **`fclose`**, see **`_fclose_nolock`**.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

## Requirements

|Function|Required header|
|--------------|---------------------|
|**`fclose`**|`<stdio.h>`|
|**`_fcloseall`**|`<stdio.h>`|
