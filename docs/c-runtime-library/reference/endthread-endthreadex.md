# `_endthread`, `_endthreadex`

Terminates a thread; **`_endthread`** terminates a thread that's created by **`_beginthread`** and  **`_endthreadex`** terminates a thread that's created by **`_beginthreadex`**.

## Syntax

```C
void _endthread( void );
void _endthreadex(
   unsigned retval
);
```

### Parameters

*`retval`*\
Thread exit code.

## Remarks

You can call **`_endthread`** or **`_endthreadex`** explicitly to terminate a thread; however, **`_endthread`** or **`_endthreadex`** is called automatically when the thread returns from the routine passed as a parameter to **`_beginthread`** or **`_beginthreadex`**. Terminating a thread with a call to **`endthread`** or **`_endthreadex`** helps ensure proper recovery of resources allocated for the thread.

> [!NOTE]
> For an executable file linked with Libcmt.lib, do not call the Win32 [`ExitThread`](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-exitthread) API; this prevents the run-time system from reclaiming allocated resources. **`_endthread`** and **`_endthreadex`** reclaim allocated thread resources and then call **`ExitThread`**.

**`_endthread`** automatically closes the thread handle. (This behavior differs from the Win32 **`ExitThread`** API.) Therefore, when you use **`_beginthread`** and **`_endthread`**, don't explicitly close the thread handle by calling the Win32 [`CloseHandle`](/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle) API.

Like the Win32 **`ExitThread`** API, **`_endthreadex`** doesn't close the thread handle. Therefore, when you use **`_beginthreadex`** and **`_endthreadex`**, you must close the thread handle by calling the Win32 **`CloseHandle`** API.

> [!NOTE]
> **`_endthread`** and **`_endthreadex`** cause C++ destructors pending in the thread not to be called.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).
