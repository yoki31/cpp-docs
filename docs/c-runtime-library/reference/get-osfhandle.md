# `_get_osfhandle`

Retrieves the operating-system file handle that is associated with the specified file descriptor.

## Syntax

```C
intptr_t _get_osfhandle(
   int fd
);
```

### Parameters

*`fd`*\
An existing file descriptor.

## Return Value

Returns an operating-system file handle if *`fd`* is valid. Otherwise, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, it returns **`INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`** (-1). It also sets **`errno`** to **`EBADF`**, indicating an invalid file handle. To avoid a warning when the result is used as a Win32 file handle, cast it to a **`HANDLE`** type.

> [!NOTE]
> When **`stdin`**, **`stdout`**, and **`stderr`** aren't associated with a stream (for example, in a Windows application without a console window), the file descriptor values for these streams are returned from [`_fileno`](fileno.md) as the special value -2. Similarly, if you use a 0, 1, or 2 as the file descriptor parameter instead of the result of a call to **`_fileno`**, **`_get_osfhandle`** also returns the special value -2 when the file descriptor is not associated with a stream, and does not set **`errno`**. However, this is not a valid file handle value, and subsequent calls that attempt to use it are likely to fail.

For more information about **`EBADF`** and other error codes, see [`_doserrno`, `errno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

To close a file whose operating system (OS) file handle is obtained by **`_get_osfhandle`**, call [`_close`](close.md) on the file descriptor *`fd`*. Never call **`CloseHandle`** on the return value of this function. The underlying OS file handle is owned by the *`fd`* file descriptor, and is closed when [`_close`](close.md) is called on *`fd`*. If the file descriptor is owned by a `FILE *` stream, then calling [`fclose`](fclose-fcloseall.md) on that `FILE *` stream closes both the file descriptor and the underlying OS file handle. In this case, don't call [`_close`](close.md) on the file descriptor.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).
