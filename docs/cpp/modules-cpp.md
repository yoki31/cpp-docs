# Overview of modules in C++

C++20 introduces *modules*, a modern solution that turns C++ libraries and programs into components. A *module* is a set of source code files that are compiled independently of the [translation units](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_unit_(programming)) that import them. Modules eliminate or reduce many of the problems associated with the use of header files. They often reduce compilation times. Macros, preprocessor directives, and non-exported names declared in a module aren't visible outside the module. They have no effect on the compilation of the translation unit that imports the module. You can import modules in any order without concern for macro redefinitions. Declarations in the importing translation unit don't participate in overload resolution or name lookup in the imported module. After a module is compiled once, the results are stored in a binary file that describes all the exported types, functions, and templates. The compiler can process that file much faster than a header file. And, the compiler can reuse it every place where the module is imported in a project.

You can use modules side by side with header files. A C++ source file can `import` modules and also `#include` header files. In some cases, you can import a header file as a module rather than include it textually by using `#include` in the preprocessor. We recommend you use modules in new projects rather than header files as much as possible. For larger existing projects under active development, experiment with converting legacy headers to modules. Base your adoption on whether you get a meaningful reduction in compilation times.

## Enable modules in the Microsoft C++ compiler

Modules have had experimental support in the Microsoft C++ compiler for a long time. As of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1, C++20 standard modules are fully implemented in the Microsoft C++ compiler. You can use the modules feature to create single-partition modules and to import the Standard Library modules provided by Microsoft. To enable support for Standard Library modules, compile with [`/experimental:module`](../build/reference/experimental-module.md) and [`/std:c++latest`](../build/reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md). In a Visual Studio project, right-click the project node in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Properties**. Set the **Configuration** drop-down to **All Configurations**, then choose **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Language** > **Enable C++ Modules (experimental)**.

A module and the code that consumes it must be compiled with the same compiler options.

## Consume the C++ Standard Library as modules

Although not specified by the C++20 standard, Microsoft makes its implementation of the C++ Standard Library importable as modules. By importing the C++ Standard Library as modules rather than including it through header files, you can potentially speed up compilation times depending on the size of your project. The library is split into the following named modules:

- `std.regex` provides the content of header `<regex>`
- `std.filesystem` provides the content of header `<filesystem>`
- `std.memory` provides the content of header `<memory>`
- `std.threading` provides the contents of headers `<atomic>`, `<condition_variable>`, `<future>`, `<mutex>`, `<shared_mutex>`, and `<thread>`
- `std.core` provides everything else in the C++ Standard Library

To consume these modules, add an import declaration to the top of the source code file. For example:

```cpp
import std.core;
import std.regex;
```

To consume the Microsoft Standard Library modules, compile your program with [`/EHsc`](../build/reference/eh-exception-handling-model.md) and [`/MD`](../build/reference/md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library.md) options.

## Basic example

The following example shows a simple module definition in a source file called *`Example.ixx`*. The *`.ixx`* extension is required for module interface files in Visual Studio. In this example, the interface file contains both the function definition and the declaration. However, you can also place the definitions in one or more separate module implementation files, as shown in a later example. The `export module Example;` statement indicates that this file is the primary interface for a module called `Example`. The **`export`** modifier on `f()` indicates that this function is visible when `Example` is imported by another program or module. The module references a namespace `Example_NS`.

```cpp
// Example.ixx
export module Example;

#define ANSWER 42

namespace Example_NS
{
   int f_internal() {
        return ANSWER;
      }

   export int f() {
      return f_internal();
   }
}
```

The file *`MyProgram.cpp`* uses the **`import`** declaration to access the name that is exported by `Example`. The name `Example_NS` is visible here, but not all of its members. Also, the macro `ANSWER` isn't visible.

```cpp
// MyProgram.cpp
import Example;
import std.core;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   cout << "The result of f() is " << Example_NS::f() << endl; // 42
   // int i = Example_NS::f_internal(); // C2039
   // int j = ANSWER; //C2065
}
```

The `import` declaration can appear only at global scope.

## Implementing modules

A *module interface* exports the module name and all the namespaces, types, functions and so on that make up the public interface of the module. A *module implementation* defines the things exported by the module. In its simplest form, a module can consist of a single file that combines the module interface and implementation. You can also put the implementations in one or more separate module implementation files, similar to how *`.h`* and *`.cpp`* files are used.

For larger modules, you can split parts of the module into submodules called *partitions*. Each partition consists of a module interface file that exports a module partition name. A partition may also have one or more partition implementation files. The module as a whole has one *primary module interface*, the public interface of the module that may also import and export the partition interfaces.

A module consists of one or more *module units*. A module unit is a translation unit (a source file) that contains a module declaration. There are several types of module units:

- A *module interface unit* is a module unit that exports a module name or module partition name. A module interface unit has `export module` in its module declaration.

- A *module implementation unit* is a module unit that doesn't export a module name or module partition name. As the name implies, it's used to implement a module.

- A *primary module interface unit* is a module interface unit that exports the module name. There must be one and only one primary module interface unit in a module.

- A *module partition interface unit* is a module interface unit that exports a module partition name.

- A *module partition implementation unit* is a module implementation unit that has a module partition name in its module declaration, but no `export` keyword.

The **`export`** keyword is used in interface files only. An implementation file can **`import`** another module, but can't **`export`** any names. Implementation files can have any extension.

## Modules, namespaces, and argument-dependent lookup

The rules for namespaces in modules are the same as in any other code. If a declaration within a namespace is exported, the enclosing namespace (excluding non-exported members) is also implicitly exported. If a namespace is explicitly exported, all declarations within that namespace definition are exported.

When it does argument-dependent lookup for overload resolutions in the importing translation unit, the compiler considers functions declared in the same translation unit (including module interfaces) as where the type of the function's arguments are defined.

### Module partitions

A module partition is similar to a module, except it shares ownership of all declarations in the entire module. All names exported by partition interface files are imported and re-exported by the primary interface file. A partition's name must begin with the module name followed by a colon. Declarations in any of the partitions are visible within the entire module. No special precautions are needed to avoid one-definition-rule (ODR) errors. You can declare a name (function, class, and so on) in one partition and define it in another. A partition implementation file begins like this:

```cpp
module Example:part1;
```

The partition interface file begins like this:

```cpp
export module Example:part1;
```

To access declarations in another partition, a partition must import it, but it can only use the partition name, not the module name:

```cpp
module Example:part2;
import :part1;
```

The primary interface unit must import and re-export all of the module's interface partition files like this:

```cpp
export import :part1;
export import :part2;
...
```

The primary interface unit can import partition implementation files, but can't export them. Those files aren't allowed to export any names. This restriction enables a module to keep implementation details internal to the module.

## Modules and header files

You can include header files in a module source file by putting the `#include` directive before the module declaration. These files are considered to be in the *global module fragment*. A module can only see the names in the global module fragment that are in headers it explicitly includes. The global module fragment only contains symbols that are used.

```cpp
// MyModuleA.cpp

#include "customlib.h"
#include "anotherlib.h"

import std.core;
import MyModuleB;

//... rest of file
```

You can use a traditional header file to control which modules are imported:

```cpp
// MyProgram.h
import std.core;
#ifdef DEBUG_LOGGING
import std.filesystem;
#endif
```

### Imported header files

Some headers are sufficiently self-contained that they can be brought in using the **`import`** keyword. The main difference between an imported header and an imported module is that any preprocessor definitions in the header are visible in the importing program immediately after the `import` statement.

```cpp
import <vector>;
import "myheader.h";
```
