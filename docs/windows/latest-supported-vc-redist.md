# Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported downloads

The Visual C++ Redistributable installs Microsoft C and C++ (MSVC) runtime libraries. These libraries are required by many applications built by using Microsoft C and C++ tools. If your app uses those libraries, a Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package must be installed on the target system before you install your app. The Redistributable package architecture must match your app's target architecture. The Redistributable version must be at least as recent as the MSVC build toolset used to build your app. We recommend you use the latest Redistributable available for your version of Visual Studio, with some exceptions noted below.

For details on how to install and redistribute Visual Studio components, see [Redistributing Visual C++ Files](redistributing-visual-cpp-files.md).

### Notes

- Visual Studio versions since Visual Studio 2015 share the same Redistributable files. For example, any apps built by the Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, or 2022 toolsets can use the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. However, the version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed on the machine must be the same or higher than the version of the Visual C++ toolset used to create your application. For more information about which version of the Redistributable to install, see [Determining which DLLs to redistribute](determining-which-dlls-to-redistribute.md).

- **Windows XP Support**: Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014. Current versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022 only support Windows Vista, 7, 8.1, 10, and 11. The last version of the Visual C++ Redistributable that works on Windows XP shipped in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7 (file versions starting with **14.27**). The Redistributable is available in the [my.visualstudio.com Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads/) section as **Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 - Version 16.7**. Use the Search box to find this version. To download the files, select the platform and language you need, and then choose the **Download** button.
