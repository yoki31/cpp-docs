# Building Browse Information Files: Overview

> [!WARNING]
> Although BSCMAKE is still installed with Visual Studio, it's no longer used by the IDE. Since Visual Studio 2008, browse and symbol information is stored automatically in a SQL Server *`.sdf`* file in the solution folder.

To create browse information for symbol browsing, the compiler creates an *`.sbr`* file for each source file in your project, then BSCMAKE.EXE concatenates the *`.sbr`* files into one *`.bsc`* file.

Generating *`.sbr`* and *`.bsc`* files takes time, so Visual Studio turns off these functions by default. If you want to browse current information, you must turn on the browse options and build your project again.

Use [`/FR`](fr-fr-create-dot-sbr-file.md) or [`/Fr`](fr-fr-create-dot-sbr-file.md) to tell the compiler to create *`.sbr`* files. To create *`.bsc`* files, you can call [BSCMAKE](bscmake-command-line.md) from the command line. Using BSCMAKE from the command line gives you more precise control over the manipulation of browse information files. For more information, see [BSCMAKE reference](bscmake-reference.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can turn on *`.sbr`* file generation but leave *`.bsc`* file generation turned off. This provides fast builds but also enables you to create a fresh *`.bsc`* file quickly by turning on *`.bsc`* file generation and building the project.

You can reduce the time, memory, and disk space required to build a *`.bsc`* file by reducing the size of the *`.bsc`* file.

See [General Property Page (Project)](general-property-page-project.md) for information on how to build a browser file in the development environment.

### To create a smaller `.bsc` file

1. Use [BSCMAKE command-line options](bscmake-options.md) to exclude information from the browse information file.

1. Omit local symbols in one or more *`.sbr`* files when compiling or assembling.

1. If an object file doesn't contain information needed for your current stage of debugging, omit its *`.sbr`* file from the BSCMAKE command when you rebuild the browse information file.

### To combine the browse information from several projects into one browser file (`.bsc`)

1. Either don't build the *`.bsc`* file at the project level or use the **`/n`** switch to prevent the *`.sbr`* files from being truncated.

1. After all the projects are built, run BSCMAKE with all of the *`.sbr`* files as input. Wildcards are accepted. For instance, if you had project directories *`C:\X`*, *`C:\Y`*, and *`C:\Z`* with *`.sbr`* files in them and you wanted to combine them all into one *`.bsc`* file, then use `BSCMAKE  C:\X\*.sbr C:\Y\*.sbr C:\Z\*.sbr /o c:\whatever_directory\combined.bsc` to build the combined *`.bsc`* file.
