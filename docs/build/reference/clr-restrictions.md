# `/clr` Restrictions

Note the following restrictions on the use of **`/clr`**:

- In a structured exception handler, there are restrictions on using `_alloca` when compiling with **`/clr`**. For more information, see [`_alloca`](../../c-runtime-library/reference/alloca.md).

- The use of run-time error checks isn't valid with **`/clr`**. For more information, see [How to: Use native run-time checks](/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-use-native-run-time-checks).

- When **`/clr`** is used to compile a program that only uses standard C++ syntax, the following guidelines apply to the use of inline assembly:

  - Inline assembly code that assumes knowledge of the native stack layout, calling conventions outside of the current function, or other low-level information about the computer may fail if that knowledge is applied to the stack frame for a managed function. Functions containing inline assembly code are generated as unmanaged functions, as if they were placed in a separate module that was compiled without **`/clr`**.

  - Inline assembly code in functions that pass copy-constructed function parameters isn't supported.

- The [`vprintf` Functions](../../c-runtime-library/vprintf-functions.md) can't be called from a program compiled with **`/clr`**.

- The [`naked`](../../cpp/naked-cpp.md) [`__declspec`](../../cpp/declspec.md) modifier is ignored under **`/clr`**.

- The translator function set by [`_set_se_translator`](../../c-runtime-library/reference/set-se-translator.md) will affect only catches in unmanaged code. For more information, see [Exception handling](../../extensions/exception-handling-cpp-component-extensions.md).

- The comparison of function pointers isn't permitted under **`/clr`**.

- The use of functions that aren't fully prototyped isn't permitted under **`/clr`**.

- The following compiler options aren't supported with **`/clr`**:

  - **`/EHsc`** and **`/EHs`** (**`/clr`** implies **`/EHa`** (see [`/EH` (Exception Handling Model)](eh-exception-handling-model.md))

  - **`/fp:strict`** and **`/fp:except`** (see [`/fp` (Specify Floating-Point Behavior)](fp-specify-floating-point-behavior.md))

  - [`/Zd`](z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md)

  - [`/Gm`](gm-enable-minimal-rebuild.md)

  - [`/MT`](md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library.md)

  - [`/RTC`](rtc-run-time-error-checks.md)

  - [`/ZI`](z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md)

- The combination of the `_STATIC_CPPLIB` preprocessor definition (`/D_STATIC_CPPLIB`) and the **`/clr`** compiler option isn't supported. It's because the definition would cause your application to link with the static, multithreaded C++ Standard Library, which isn't supported. For more information, see [`/MD`, `/MT`, `/LD` (Use Run-Time Library)](md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library.md).

- When you use **`/Zi`** with **`/clr`**, there are performance implications. For more information, see [`/Zi`](z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md).

- Passing a wide character to a .NET Framework output routine without also specifying [`/Zc:wchar_t`](zc-wchar-t-wchar-t-is-native-type.md) or without casting the character to **`_wchar_t`** will cause the output to appear as an `unsigned short int`. For example:

    ```cpp
    Console::WriteLine(L' ')              // Will output 32.
    Console::WriteLine((__wchar_t)L' ')   // Will output a space.
    ```

- [`/GS`](gs-buffer-security-check.md) is ignored when compiling with **`/clr`**, unless a function is under [`#pragma unmanaged`](../../preprocessor/managed-unmanaged.md) or if the function must be compiled as native code, in which case the compiler will generate warning C4793, which is off by default.

- See [`/ENTRY`](entry-entry-point-symbol.md) for function signature requirements of a managed application.

- Applications compiled with **`/openmp`** and **`/clr`** can only be run in a single appdomain process. For more information, see [`/openmp` (Enable OpenMP 2.0 Support)](openmp-enable-openmp-2-0-support.md).

- Functions that take a variable number of arguments (varargs) will be generated as native functions. Any managed data types in the variable argument position will be marshaled to native types. Any <xref:System.String?displayProperty=fullName> types are actually wide-character strings, but they're marshaled to single-byte character strings. So if a `printf` specifier is `%S` (`wchar_t*`), it will marshal to a `%s` string instead.

- When using the `va_arg` macro, you may get unexpected results when compiling with **`/clr:pure`**. For more information, see [`va_arg`, `va_copy`, `va_end`, `va_start`](../../c-runtime-library/reference/va-arg-va-copy-va-end-va-start.md). The **`/clr:pure`** and **`/clr:safe`** compiler options are deprecated in Visual Studio 2015 and unsupported in Visual Studio 2017 and later. Code that must be "pure" or "safe" should be ported to C#.

- You shouldn't call any functions that walk the stack to get parameter information (function arguments) from managed code. The P/Invoke layer causes that information to be further down the stack. For example, don't compile proxy/stub with **`/clr`**.

- Functions will be compiled to managed code whenever possible, but not all C++ constructs can be translated to managed code.  This determination is made on a function-by-function basis. If any part of a function can't be converted to managed code, the entire function will be converted to native code instead. The following cases prevent the compiler from generating managed code.

  - Compiler-generated thunks or helper functions. Native thunks are generated for any function call through a function pointer, including virtual function calls.

  - Functions that call `setjmp` or `longjmp`.

  - Functions that use certain intrinsic routines to directly manipulate machine resources. For example, the use of `__enable` and `__disable`, `_ReturnAddress` and `_AddressOfReturnAddress`, or multimedia intrinsics will all result in native code.

  - Functions that follow the `#pragma unmanaged` directive. (The inverse, `#pragma managed`, is also supported.)

  - A function that contains references to aligned types, that is, types declared using `__declspec(align(...))`.
