# C6289

> warning C6289: Incorrect operator: mutual exclusion over \|\| is always a non-zero constant. Did you intend to use && instead?

This warning indicates that in a test expression a variable is being tested against two different constants and the result depends on either condition being true. This always evaluates to true.

This problem is generally caused by using `||` in place of `&&`, but can also be caused by using `!=` where `==` was intended.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f(int x)
{
  if ((x != 1) || (x != 3))
  {
    // code
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f(int x)
{
  if ((x != 1) && (x != 3))
  {
    // code
  }
}

/* or */
void f(int x)
{
  if ((x == 1) || (x == 3))
  {
    // code
  }
}
```
