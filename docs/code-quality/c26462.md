# C26462 USE_CONST_POINTER_FOR_VARIABLE

The value pointed to by '%variable%' is assigned only once, mark it as a pointer to `const` (con.4).

Pointers to variables whose values remain unchanged should be marked as `const`.

[C++ Core Guidelines con.4](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#con4-use-const-to-define-objects-with-values-that-do-not-change-after-construction).

## Example

```cpp
void useVal(int val);

void function1(int* ptr)
{
    int* p = ptr; // C26462, the value pointed to by p is unmodified
    ptr = nullptr;

    useVal(*p);
}
```
